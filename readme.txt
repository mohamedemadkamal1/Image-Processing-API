# Welcome to image proccessin API Guide.

# You can resize the image that you want by just entring its name and the width and the height that you like to resize it to.

# You can do this by accessing the sizing endpoint from local host at port 3000

# We can do this by using query parameters.

# e.g. http://localhost:3000/sizing?name=wolf&width=500&height=700

# Image name e.g. wolf and swords

# only enter a valid image name and positive integers for the width and height so that you can get the new resized image.

# Any resized image will be add to the ./thumbnails folder by its name and its new width and height.

# Caching has been added to the project so that if we try to get an already resized image we get it directly without resizing it again.



# Scripts that can be used:

1- prettier => to run prettier.
2- lint => to run lint.

4- jasmine => to run unit test with jasmine.
5- test => to run build and jasmine scripts together.
6- start => to start nodemon so that we can see imediate changes in our server.
7- server => to run build and start scripts together.

# Testing has been added to the project functions and endpoints to avoid any problem.

# Tybe script is used in the project and all codes are written in TS and compiled to JS after running the build script.
